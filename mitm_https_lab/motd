   -- By Group 8: Sahil Tikale, Leen AlShenibr, Chang Yan

This VM has a http nginx webserver running at port 80
The secure nginx (https) server is listening on port 45373 

To initiate the man-in-middle-attack, use command 
setupmitm -i; mitmproxy -T --host
Once done, exit mitmproxy. 
To resume access to http and https server without mitmproxy run: 
setupmitm -d 

At anytime if you wish to query the iptable rules run:
setupmitm -q
